Comic Neue font placeholder.

Manual step required: Download Comic Neue (OFL licensed) from https://github.com/crozynski/comicneue or Google Fonts download and place TTF files here (Regular, Bold, Light, Italic variants if desired). Include the OFL.txt license file.

Once files are present the font_manager will load them at startup and "Comic Neue" will appear in the UI/Text/Code font selectors.
