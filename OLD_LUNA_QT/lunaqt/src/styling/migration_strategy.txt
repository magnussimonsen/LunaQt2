Migration Strategy (Step-by-Step):

Step 1: Create new structure (safe, non-breaking)
Create src/styling/ directory
Copy files to new location (keep originals)
Update imports in copied files

Step 2: Update imports (one module at a time)
Update ThemeManager imports
Update FontService imports
Update MainWindow imports
Test after each change

Step 3: Clean up
Delete old files only after all imports updated
Delete empty directories
