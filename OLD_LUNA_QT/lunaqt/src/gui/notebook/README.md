# Notebook UI (planned)

This package will host the notebook widgets after the basic MVP is running.

Planned components:
- NotebookView container (QListWidget-based)
- Cells: BaseCell, CodeCell, MarkdownCell
- Toolbars: Default, Code, Markdown
- Styles: notebook_qss.py

These are intentionally deferred to keep MVP small and composable.
